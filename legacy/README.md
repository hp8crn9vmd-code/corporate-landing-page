# Legacy Static Files

This folder contains older/static artifacts that were previously placed at the repository root:
- `index.html`
- `main.js`
- `styles.css`

The production site is the **Next.js** app under `/app` (and later `/src`), deployed as a static export to GitHub Pages.
These legacy files are kept only for reference and should not be used as the main source of truth.
